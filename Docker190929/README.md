## Docker5:cron+PATH
*	THis item is a litle diffcult,when you get into the container,you can see "run","profile","cron_script","writable",and then,the system will generate "flag".so,there 5 file in the file /home/test.you should analyze the relation about them.the relation about them is:"cron_script"-->"profile" and "writbale" -->"run"-->"flag",as you can see,there is a code "source /home/test/profile" in the "cron_script",this is the environment PATH os crontab.and the code "getflag" is in "run",so,we can think about where the getflag is,there is another diffcult point is that the linux PATH is not equal to crontabs PATH.so,coppy the content and delete the "profile",create a new "profile" and paste the content,the most important step is you should delete "/tmp" in the contents.wait a moments,and you can see the flag.
